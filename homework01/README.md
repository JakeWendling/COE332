The homework01 directory contains the following python scripts:

script01.py: Finds the 5 longest words in the "words" file, where ties go to the words that would appear first alphabetically

script02.py: Uses the names module to print out five names that are exactly eight characters each (nine characters if you include the space)

script03.py: Uses the names module to generate a list of five different full names and defines a function to determine the length of a given name (in number of characters, excluding spaces)
